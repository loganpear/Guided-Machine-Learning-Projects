# Guided Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my collection of guided machine learning projects! This repository showcases various projects I've completed by following machine learning tutorials on YouTube. As of July 2024, I am in my second month of learning machine learning. Guided tutorials have become one of my favorite ways to acquire new skills and deepen my understanding of this exciting field.

Feel free to explore the projects and see the progress I've made. I hope you find them as educational and inspiring as I have. Happy learning!
